Core Play
=========

This is the Play 2 project accompanying my presentation called "Core Play". It contains all the sample code in the slides, and serves as a starting point for the 'Hands On' session.

Getting started
---------------

This is just an SBT application; you don't need Play 2.

Run `sbt run`

Open a browser and add url: http://localhost:9000/websockets

In the websocket address field enter: ws://localhost:9000/websockets/cpu-info

Repeat this in other tabs, connect and disconnect and see in the logs what happens. As you might have seen I do not acquire real cpu info, it's just a counter. But the idea should be clear.
